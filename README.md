# bowling-desktop
Simple GUI application to record 10-pin bowling scores; written in Java and built with Maven.

To run the application, download the bowling-desktop-1.0.0.jar file in the 'releases' folder.  If you have Java 1.8 installed, this should be executable by double-clicking the corresponding GUI icon, or by navigating to the directory containing the file and executing: 'java -jar bowling-desktop-1.0.0.jar' (without the quotation marks).

The 'documentation' folder contains full JavaDoc for the source code contained in the 'src' directory, as well as an outline requirements specification document that was written at the outset of the project.
